## codecov

- use irongut/CodeCoverageSummary@v1.3.0 to upload and display coverage report on PRs
- Artifacts are only useful if you need to manually download/review HTML reports (optional)

- Note that `CodeCoverageSummary` would output a `code-coverage-results.md` markdown file as a result.

- You can use ` marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2` to add Coverage PR comment
