# Exercise 09 — Security and hygiene

## Goal

Harden your workflows with action pinning, least privilege permissions, and a basic image scan.

## You will create

- `.github/workflows/exercice09-security-pin-scan.yml`

## Requirements

- Pin third-party actions by commit SHA (not just `@vX`)
- Set `permissions:` explicitly
- Add a non-blocking container vulnerability scan job for the API image

## Done when

- Workflow succeeds, and the scan produces a report/logs without failing the pipeline.

## What to share for review

- The workflow file content
- Evidence of pinned SHAs
- Scan output snippet
